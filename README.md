My interpretation of Robert Nystrom's Lox Interpreter from his book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

Implements a Tree-walk interpreter. Scans, parses, then evaluates. Makes use of recursive descent parsing. 

Using some supporting files from Codecrafters. 

Everything in the app folder is written by me.
